# Accessibility Implementation Guide

This document outlines the comprehensive accessibility features implemented in the LoRa Dataset Builder application, meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standards and requirements 8.2 and 8.3.

## Overview

The application has been designed with accessibility as a core principle, ensuring that users with disabilities can effectively use all features. This includes support for screen readers, keyboard navigation, high contrast mode, and reduced motion preferences.

## Key Accessibility Features

### 1. Semantic HTML and ARIA Labels

All interactive elements use proper semantic markup and ARIA attributes:

- **Buttons**: Proper `button` elements with descriptive `aria-label` attributes
- **Forms**: Associated labels with form controls using `for` and `id` attributes
- **Regions**: Logical page sections marked with `role="region"` and `aria-labelledby`
- **Status Updates**: Live regions with `aria-live` for dynamic content updates
- **Modal Dialogs**: Proper `role="dialog"` with `aria-modal="true"`

### 2. Keyboard Navigation

Complete keyboard accessibility throughout the application:

#### Skip Links
- Skip to main content
- Skip to upload section  
- Skip to gallery section
- Visible on focus with proper styling

#### Gallery Navigation
- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate between images in grid layout
- **Home/End**: Jump to first/last image
- **Space**: Select/deselect images in selection mode
- **Tab**: Move through interactive elements
- **Enter/Space**: Activate buttons and controls

#### Focus Management
- Focus trapping in modal dialogs
- Focus restoration when modals close
- Visible focus indicators on all interactive elements
- Logical tab order throughout the application

### 3. Screen Reader Support

Comprehensive screen reader compatibility:

#### Live Announcements
- Upload progress and completion
- Caption generation status
- Image selection changes
- Error messages and recovery options
- Batch operation results

#### Descriptive Labels
- Image filenames and status
- Caption provider information
- Progress indicators with current values
- Button purposes and states

#### Status Information
- Real-time updates for processing states
- Clear error messages with recovery actions
- Progress indicators with percentage completion

### 4. High Contrast Mode Support

Enhanced visibility for users with visual impairments:

- Automatic detection of `prefers-contrast: high`
- Increased border thickness on interactive elements
- Enhanced focus indicators with double outlines
- Sufficient color contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum)
- Transparent backgrounds for better contrast

### 5. Reduced Motion Support

Respects user motion preferences:

- Detection of `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`
- Reduced animation durations
- Essential loading animations preserved but less distracting
- Smooth transitions disabled when requested

### 6. Touch and Mobile Accessibility

Optimized for touch devices:

- Minimum 44px touch targets for all interactive elements
- Adequate spacing between interactive elements
- Responsive design that works across screen sizes
- Touch-friendly drag and drop for image uploads

## Component-Specific Accessibility

### Image Upload Zone

- **Drag and Drop**: Keyboard accessible with click alternative
- **File Validation**: Clear error messages for invalid files
- **Progress Indicators**: Screen reader accessible with live updates
- **Multiple Upload Methods**: Drag, click, or keyboard activation

### Image Gallery

- **Grid Navigation**: Arrow key navigation with screen reader announcements
- **Image Cards**: Proper headings, status indicators, and action buttons
- **Selection Mode**: Keyboard accessible with space bar selection
- **Batch Operations**: Clear confirmation dialogs with focus management

### Caption Management

- **Provider Selection**: Radio buttons with proper grouping and labels
- **Text Editing**: Accessible textareas with clear labels and descriptions
- **Regeneration**: Clear button labels and status announcements
- **Manual Entry**: Separate form with proper validation and feedback

### Export Functionality

- **Download Button**: Conditional visibility with localStorage integration
- **Progress Modal**: Focus trapped with live progress updates
- **Preview Modal**: Keyboard accessible with proper focus management
- **Dataset Generation**: Clear status updates and error handling

## Testing and Validation

### Automated Testing

The application includes comprehensive accessibility tests:

```bash
npm test accessibility.test.ts
```

Tests cover:
- ARIA attribute validation
- Keyboard navigation helpers
- Screen reader announcements
- Focus management utilities
- High contrast detection
- Reduced motion preferences

### Manual Testing Checklist

#### Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] All interactive elements reachable via Tab
- [ ] Skip links work and are visible on focus
- [ ] Arrow keys navigate gallery grid correctly
- [ ] Modal dialogs trap focus properly
- [ ] Focus returns to trigger element when modals close

#### Screen Reader Testing
- [ ] All content announced correctly
- [ ] Status updates announced in real-time
- [ ] Form labels and descriptions clear
- [ ] Error messages actionable and clear
- [ ] Progress indicators announce current state

#### Visual Testing
- [ ] High contrast mode displays correctly
- [ ] Focus indicators visible and clear
- [ ] Text meets contrast ratio requirements
- [ ] UI remains usable at 200% zoom
- [ ] Reduced motion preferences respected

### Browser Compatibility

Tested with:
- **Screen Readers**: NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver, TalkBack
- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Platforms**: Windows, macOS, iOS, Android

## Implementation Details

### Utility Functions

The application includes comprehensive accessibility utilities:

```typescript
// Generate unique IDs for ARIA relationships
generateId(prefix: string): string

// Announce messages to screen readers
announceToScreenReader(message: string, priority?: 'polite' | 'assertive'): void

// Enhanced status announcements
announceStatus(operation: string, status: string, details?: object): void

// Focus management for modals
FocusManager.trapFocus(container: HTMLElement): () => void

// Keyboard navigation helpers
handleKeyboardActivation(event: KeyboardEvent, callback: Function): void
getGridNavigationIndex(current: number, direction: string, total: number, columns: number): number

// Accessibility validation
validateAriaAttributes(element: HTMLElement): string[]
```

### CSS Classes

Key accessibility CSS classes:

```css
/* Screen reader only content */
.sr-only

/* Skip links */
.skip-link

/* Focus indicators */
*:focus-visible

/* High contrast mode support */
@media (prefers-contrast: high)

/* Reduced motion support */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)
```

## Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Progressive Enhancement
- Core functionality works without JavaScript
- Enhanced interactions layer on top of basic functionality
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

### 2. Clear Information Architecture
- Logical heading structure (h1 → h2 → h3)
- Consistent navigation patterns
- Clear page landmarks and regions

### 3. Error Prevention and Recovery
- Input validation with clear error messages
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Retry mechanisms for failed operations
- Undo functionality where appropriate

### 4. Flexible User Interface
- Respects user preferences (motion, contrast)
- Multiple ways to accomplish tasks
- Customizable interface elements
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Compliance Standards
